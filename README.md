Agile Four Key Principles and Tech Role

This project is a 5-part project that you'll do in your buddy groups (the groups you share a PD Buddy/Tech Buddy).

- You will work together under the guidance of your PD mentor, to complete your project using Agile philosophies.
- Your PD mentor is there to act as a guide, not to do your project for you. If you are struggling with communication issues, time management to complete the objectives of your project or understanding agile, you may ask your Buddy.
